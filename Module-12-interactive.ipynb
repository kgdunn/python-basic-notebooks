    "## Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use ``pandas`` if you already can use tools like MATLAB and Excel?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In MATLAB you have arrays (matrix) of data. Pandas adds column headings and row labels (indexes) and calls the result a ``DataFrame``. Think of a spreadsheet.\n",
    "* In Pandas we often use the variable name ``df`` to refer to the data frame.\n",
    "* The advantage of using column heading is that you can then write code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``df[\"TemperatureC\"] = (df[\"TemperatureF\"] - 32) * 5 / 9``\n",
    "\n",
    "  to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius for the entire column. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  You do *not* need to  know the column number, like in MATLAB, where you have to write ``X(:, 5) = (X(:, 2) - 32) * 5 / 9``, for example. In a spreadsheet you typically also write your formulas using the column labels, like ``= (B:B - 32) * 5 / 9``, if column B is the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "* Apart from referring to columns (or rows) by name, you can also merge two data frames together: for example to merge data from the lab, and data from the process. You have to specify which column is the common column. In Excel you can use `VLOOKUP` to do this, but it is messy, and with MATLAB you have to write code yourself to merge two data sets.\n",
    "* With Pandas, if your row names are time-based, then you can take advantage of that: e.g. you can, with 1 line of code, calculate the average over a week, or a month. In other languages you have to manually program that averaging, including taking into account that months sometimes have 28, 29, 30 or 31 days.\n",
    "* Data which are not time-based are equally well handled by Pandas.\n",
    "* Pandas also has multi-level indexing, or hierarchical indexing. More on that later.\n",
    "* If you do something on a data frame, like calculate an average over all rows, then the output result also gets those labels, the column headings in this case, kept in place.\n",
    "* Pandas takes care of missing data handling. So if you calculate the average, it will, by default, ignore missing values. Unlike MATLAB where you get `nan` as a result.\n",
    "* With Pandas you can quickly visualize your data, often with  1 line of code: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * ``df[\"TemperatureC\"].plot()``\n",
    "    * ``df.boxplot(column='activity', by='reactor')`` will create a boxplot of the values in the `activity` column, for every `reactor` \n",
