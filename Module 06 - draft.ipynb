    "\n",
    "A standard features in any programming language is the ability to write functions: a chunk of code that takes 0 or more inputs, and returns 0 or more outputs. Useful functions however accept 1 or more inputs. Inputs are also sometimes referred to as ***arguments***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions help you:\n",
    "* split up your code, \n",
    "* make it modular, \n",
    "* allow you to reuse these modular blocks in the future in other code;\n",

    "### A template\n",

    "Please consider using this standard template for your functions:\n",

    "2. It also prevents you from making the function do more than it should. It just just do that verb.\n",
    "3. Start the code with a triple-quote comment: ```\"\"\" Calculates the mean of ... \"\"\"\n",
    "4. Using the 4-space indent on the left, write the various statements and loops to do the work.\n",
    "5. It is OK if a function is just 1-line! Why? In the future you might expand it a bit, e.g. to check the inputs, handle missing values, add extra inputs to the function. Don't think: \"It's just one line; why bother?\". If you suspect you will reuse the idea of that 1 line in several places, rather put it in a function.\n",
    "6. Return something from your function. It is not mandatory, but it is clearer. Even ```return True``` is a good signal to the user, to indicate the function did it's work successfully.\n",
