    "s = \"\"\"Secretly under development for ... the lunar surface.\"\"\"\n",

    "You can ignore all the attributes beginning and ending with a double underscore, for example ``__add__``. The attributes which are of practical use to you are the ones starting from ``capitalize``, all the way to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't need to create a string ``s`` first to get a list of the attributes. You can also use this shortcut:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dir('')\n",
    "dir(str)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "You will get a piece of help text printed to the screen. This is helpful later on when you are comfortable with Python. In the beginning it is more helpful to search in a search engine, which will give you a page with examples. The built-in Python help is usually very very brief.\n",
