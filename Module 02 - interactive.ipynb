    "\n",
    "1. You can get a **list** [we cover lists next!] of all attributes using the ``dir(...)`` command.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "s = \"\"\"Secretly under development for ... the lunar surface.\"\"\"\n",
    "dir(s)\n",
    "['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can ignore all the attributes beginning and ending with a double underscore, for example ``__add__``. The attributes which are of practical use to you are the ones starting from ``capitalize``, all the way to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't need to create a string ``s`` first to get a list of the attributes. You can also use this shortcut:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dir('')\n",
    "dir(str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you see an attribute that looks interesting, you can request help on it:  ``help(''.startswith)`` or ``help(\"\".startswith)``. Notice the ``''`` in the brackets: it creates an empty string, and then accesses the attribute ``.startswith`` and then asks for help on that. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a piece of help text printed to the screen. This is helpful later on when you are comfortable with Python. In the beginning it is more helpful to search in a search engine, which will give you a page with examples. The built-in Python help is usually very very brief.\n",
