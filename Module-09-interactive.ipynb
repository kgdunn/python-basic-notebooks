Plotting the data is one of the most effective ways to figure that out.\n",

    "> The bar plot is a univariate plot on a two-dimensional axis. The axes are not called x- or y-axes. Instead, one axis is called the ***category axis*** showing the category name, while the other, the ***value axis***, shows the value of each category as a bar.\n",

We should aim to maximize the data:ink ratio, which means high amount of data represented with as few pixels as possible. Bar plots do not do that, and so are not actually are suitable plot always. \n",

    "This does not mean you should show the bar plot in a random order. By ordering the information you make the plot easier to read, and in an underhanded way you subtly alter how the user reads the message. You can use this power to your advantage to make the message clearer, but you can also use it to frustrate your reader. Rather do the former, and not the latter."
