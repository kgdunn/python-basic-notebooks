You've probably heard: \"*always start your data analysis by plotting your data*\". There's a good reason for that: the type of statistical analysis is certainly guided by what is in that data. Plotting the data is one of the most effective ways to figure that out.\n",

    "3. Then start looking at the data. Are the data what we expect? This is the **explore** step. Use plots and table summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean** up your data. This step and the prior step are iterative. As you explore your data you notice problems, bad data, you ask questions, you gain a bit of insight into the data. You clean, and re-explore, but always with the goal(s) in mind. Or perhaps you realize already this isn't the right data to reach your objective. You need other data, so you iterate.\n",
    "\n",

    "6. From the data models and summaries and plots you start extracting the insights and conclusions you were looking for.

    "> The bar plot is a univariate plot on a two-dimensional axis. The axes are not called x- or y-axes. Instead, one axis is called the ***category axis*** showing the category name, while the other, the ***value axis***, shows the value of each category as a bar.\n",

    "Bar plots are notorious for their use of excessive 'ink': using many pixels to show a small amount of 'data'. We should aim to maximize the data:ink ratio, which means high quantities of data are represented with as few pixels as possible. Bar plots do not do that, and so are not actually a suitable plot always. \n",

    "\n",
    "The categories used in a bar plot can often be rearranged without 'breaking' the message.  We saw an example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because each bar is independent of the others. If you re-order them, the information shown - based on the length of the bars on the value axis - is still the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean you should show the bar plot in a random order. By ordering the information you make the plot easier to read, and in an underhanded way you subtly alter how the user reads the message. You can use this power to your advantage to make the message clearer, but you can also use it to frustrate your reader. Rather do the former, and not the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A terrible use of bar plots is to show time-ordered data. For example, the profit of a business is shown for each year, where the profit is the bar's height. You can of course reorder the bars, but then you break the time-based message. ***Simple rule***: if you can reorder the bars, and the ultimate message is still there, then a bar plot is OK.\n"
