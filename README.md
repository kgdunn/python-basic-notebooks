Learning Python: basic level
==================================

These notebook files are intended to help you self-learn Python.

The audience already has a basic idea about programming, about loops, about
structure of source code.

Python can be used in many areas of application, but these notebooks, as you
will see, have examples primarily from science, engineering, life sciences,
and applied mathematics.

The topics listed below give an idea of what is covered. Within in each notebook
are a series of simple or more challenging problems. The problems are designed
to build on the topics just learned, as well as the topics from earlier
notebooks.

[Notebook 1: https://yint.org/pybasic01](https://yint.org/pybasic01)

* Printing output to the screen
* Creating variables
* Variable types
* Calculations with variables
* Built-in constants and mathematical functions

[Notebook 2: https://yint.org/pybasic02](https://yint.org/pybasic02)

*  Strings
*  Lists
*  For loops: iterating
*  Commenting and variable names

[Notebook 3: https://yint.org/pybasic03](https://yint.org/pybasic03)

*  From strings to lists to strings to lists
*  If and else if branching in code
*  Reading from a file
*  Creating errors, checking for errors and handling errors
*  Challenge problems

[Notebook 4:](https://github.com/kgdunn/python-basic-notebooks/blob/master/Module%2004%20-%20interactive.ipynb)

*  Revision control. This notebook is covered using external resources.

[Notebook 5: https://yint.org/pybasic05](https://yint.org/pybasic05)

This module focuses on numerical data analysis; we introduce vectors, matrices and arrays.

* Using NumPy to create various vectors, matrices and arrays, containing specific values.
* Mathematical operations on these arrays.
* Challenge problems that require using vectors and matrices.
