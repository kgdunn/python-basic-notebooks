Learning Python: basic level
==================================

These notebook files are intended to help you self-learn Python.

The audience already has a basic idea about programming, about loops, about
structure of source code.

Python can be used in many areas of application, but these notebooks, as you
will see, have examples primarily from science, engineering, life sciences,
and applied mathematics.

The topics listed below give an idea of what is covered. Within in each notebook
are a series of simple or more challenging problems. The problems are designed
to build on the topics just learned, as well as the topics from earlier
notebooks.

[Notebook 1: https://yint.org/pybasic01](https://yint.org/pybasic01)

* Printing output to the screen
* Creating variables
* Variable types
* Calculations with variables
* Built-in constants and mathematical functions

[Notebook 2: https://yint.org/pybasic02](https://yint.org/pybasic02)

*  Strings
*  Lists
*  For loops: iterating
*  Commenting and variable names

[Notebook 3: https://yint.org/pybasic03](https://yint.org/pybasic03)

*  From strings to lists to strings to lists
*  If and else if branching in code
*  Reading from a file
*  Creating errors, checking for errors and handling errors
*  Challenge problems

[Notebook 4: https://yint.org/pybasic04](https://yint.org/pybasic04)

This module focuses on introducing vectors, matrices and arrays.

* Using NumPy to create various vectors, matrices and arrays, containing specific values.

It is a long module, but it is to bring everyone to the same level of understanding.

[Notebook 5: https://yint.org/pybasic05](https://yint.org/pybasic05)

This module focuses on mathematical operations using arrays.

* Mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, matrix math) on arrays.
* Challenge problems that require using vectors and matrices.

[Notebook 6: https://yint.org/pybasic06](https://yint.org/pybasic06)

All about functions in Python, to help make your code more modular, and reusable.
* Single inputs, or multiple inputs: arguments based on their position, or name.
* None, or single outputs, and also multiple outputs in a tuple.
* Challenge problems that recall work from prior modules, and apply your knowledge.
