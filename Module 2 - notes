Notes for modules 2 and 3
===========================

if-else
--------
Report automatically generated. If slope is positive or negative and there are no outliers. If else and elif
If flow control. Write program from sketch. If else, and, or.
Ladders;  Operator is provided as input, and two values exist. Do either +-*/ operationg; only one option gets executed.

While loop
----------
While loop with += incremental
Do while loop. Execute, then check: can be done with a break statement and condition check at end of a while True loop. 

Example. Keep going until you see a particular DNA sequence. Or peak value above certain threshold

Strings
--------
* Strings first, then lists
* len(string). First introduction to methods
* str indexing: zero based
* .find
* .index
* .pop
* Index slices. Doesn't return last element. string[3:9] will be how long?
* String indexing slice: string[3:]
* String list slicing with skip element: string[3:5:1]
* List comprehension. Find number of AGTC entries in a sequence.
* Read genome. Stop when you find first sequence of GATTAG
* OPerators on a string: string *4
* How many times does the pattern AGGTA appear in a DNA string?

Operators
----------
A += 4; also others like subtract

Style
-----
Comments: TODO comments used sparingly

Loops
-------
Make the Fibonacci series with append function
while True: 
   print('Hi')
   # Infinite while loop. How to stop it?

Files
-------
Read into list. read_lines() function and iterations on the list.
Write to file
Close file

Types
------
change from one type to another: 
* float(45)  
* int(45.7)
* round(45.7)  # different result
* chr(65)
* Won't loose precision with ints. If a is int And multiplied by float, it is upgraded

Lists
-------
* See mikedane resources
* Lists can have mixed types. Contrast to MATLAB
* Find entries which appear more than once in a list
* Common elements into two different lists. Join function equivalent?
* Count how many entries in a list are greater than a threshold. List comprehension
* Contrast with tuples. Seen before. Immutable concept introduced
* Index slices. Doesn't return last element
* Lists: append, insert, extend. Sort is special..clear() too
* Read file for the above DNA string
    import urllib.request 
    with urllib.request.urlopen('http://python.org/') as response:    
        html = response.read()
    
    
General exercises
---------------------
Random number. Guess it's vlaue. If else, while loops printing.
Calculate the molar mass given a chemical formula: C5H9NOS. Methionine. Do for others amino acids
