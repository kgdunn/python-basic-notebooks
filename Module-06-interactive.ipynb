    "## Functions: a template\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard feature in any programming language is the ability to write functions: a chunk of code that takes 0 or more inputs, and returns 0 or more outputs. Inputs are also sometimes referred to as function ***arguments***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions help you:\n",
    "* split up your code, \n",
    "* make it modular, \n",
    "* allow you to reuse these modular blocks in the future, in other code;\n",
    "* help you with debugging: you can then isolate bugs in your code by elimination. Functions that have been tested and checked are not likely to be the source of a problem any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A template\n",
    "\n",
    "Please consider using this standard template for your functions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">def verb_description(...):\n",
    ">    \"\"\"Comment of what the function does goes here.\"\"\"\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    # Commands for the function\n",
    ">    a = ...\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    return ...\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making the function name start with a verb makes it clear to you - and others - what it does. E.g. ``plot_curves(...)`` or ``transform_data(...)`` or ``save_file(...)``, etc. Starting with a verb is not a fixed requirement, and sometimes a clear function name need not have verb: in a math library, the ``log(...)`` function clearly *calculates* a log of the input; no need for ``calculate_log(...)``.\n",
    "2. But a verb does prevent you from making the function do more than it should. It just does that verb.\n",
    "3. Start the code with a triple-quote comment: ```\"\"\" Calculates the mean of ... \"\"\"```\n",
    "4. Using the 4-space indent on the left, write the various statements and loops to do the work in the function.\n",
    "5. It is OK if a function is just a single line! Why? In the future you might expand it a bit, e.g. to check the inputs, handle missing values, add extra inputs to the function. Don't think: \"It's just one line; why bother?\". If you suspect you will reuse the idea of that 1 line in several places, rather put it in a function.\n",
    "6. Return something from your function. It is not mandatory, but it is clearer. Even ```return True``` is a good signal to the user, to indicate the function did its work successfully.\n",
