    "We cover the following topics here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reviewing lists and strings, and interchanging between the two.\n",
    "2. If-else branching in your code\n",
    "3. Files: reading from a file; looping over their contents line by line.\n",
    "4. Error creation, error checking and dealing with errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the side we will cover some aspects of debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, a quick warm-up, with 10 questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many characters will be returned? ``\"my_string\"[0:5]``\n",
    "2. And here? ``\"my_string \"[5:100:2]``\n",
    "3. What method can you apply to strings to strip away any whitespace, like in the above string?\n",
    "4. What method can you apply to strings to check if the contents of the string are all numbers?\n",
    "5. What function do you use to determine the length of string?\n",
    "6. And the length of a list?\n",
    "7. You want to get, and then remove, the 4th value of the list. How do you do that?\n",
    "8. What happens when you have 2 lists and you write this command: ``list_A + list_B``?\n",
    "9. What is the value of ``output`` after this command: ``output = my_list.reverse()``?\n",
    "10. Tell your colleague how you would write a for loop to print the values in this list, but from back to front: ``[9, 7, 5, 3, 2]``"

    "## From strings to lists to strings to lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [prior module](https://yint.org/pybasic02) we focused on lists and strings separately. We also saw they have a lot in common, in terms of behaviour. But there was one key difference: lists are *mutable*, and strings are *immutable* (unchangable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things are just more intuitive with lists. For example, if we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = 'A long  sentence, with text    and faulty spacing.'``\n",
    "```\n",

    "print('There are {} words in the string.'.format(len(string_as_list)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``.split(...)`` method is extremely useful, but we did not cover it last time. You can split on any character, or characters. Try it:\n",
    "* ``my_string.split() # mmmmm, what does this do?``\n",
    "* ``my_string.split('e')``\n",
    "* ``my_string.split('en')``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**List back to a string**\n",

    "Well to recombine a split string, you can use the ``''.join()`` method. Notice that I wrote it as ``''.join()``, indicating it is a method for string types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these lines of code one-by-one, and ensure you can figure out what the ``join`` method does.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['Divided', 'we', 'fall,', 'but', 'united', 'we', 'stand.']\n",
    "print(''.join(my_list))\n",
    "print(' '.join(my_list))\n",
    "print('\\n'.join(my_list))\n",
    "print('\\t'.join(my_list))\n",
    "print(')('.join(my_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which one of the above are you most likely to use the most?\n",
    "\n",
