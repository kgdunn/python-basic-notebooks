    "\n",
    "4. **Clean** up your data. This step and the prior step are iterative. As you explore your data you notice problems, bad data, you ask questions, you gain a bit of insight into the data. You clean, and re-explore, but always with the goal(s) in mind. Or perhaps you realize already this isn't the right data to reach your objective. You need other data, so you iterate.\n",
