    "## More about ``Dictionary`` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "It was [said earlier](https://yint.org/pybasic07) that a dictionary is a Python ***object*** which is a flexible data container for other objects. It contains objects using what are called ***key*** - ***value*** pairs. You create a dictionary like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "random_objects = {'key1': 45,\n",
    "                  2:      'Yes, keys can even be integers!',\n",
    "                  3.0:    'Or floating point objects',\n",
    "                  (4,5):  'Or tuples!',\n",
    "                 }\n",
    "print(random_objects)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over the keys-values of a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a dictionary, it is common to operate on the keys, or values, or both - in an iterative loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for key, value in random_objects.items():\n",
    "    print('The key is \"{}\" and the value is: {}'.format(key, value))\n",
    "    random_objects[key] = value * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need only the values, and not the keys:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for value in random_objects.values():\n",
    "    # Do something here with\n",
    "    value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, if you need only the keys, and not the values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for key in random_objects.keys():\n",
    "    # Do something here with \n",
    "    key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting and getting key-values\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw how to set a new key or overwrite an existing key:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "random_objects['key1'] = 'will now be replaced'\n",
    "random_objects['key2'] = 'is newly added'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a value, from a given key, using the square bracket notation, and then immediately use it for further calculation or processing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "uppercase_value = random_objects['key2'].upper()\n",
    "\n",
    "# but this will fail:\n",
    "random_objects['key3']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with a ``KeyError``, because you are trying to access a non-existent key. Here are two possible solutions to deal with the case if you are not sure if the key exists, but you need your code to continue running without failing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Option 1: try-except\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    value = random_objects['key3']\n",
    "except KeyError:\n",
    "    # Key not present: use a missing value as fallback \n",
    "    value = float('nan')\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Now \"value\" is guaranteed to exist after these 4 lines.\n",
    "# Or, option 2, in a single line of code:\n",
    "value = random_objects.get('key3', float('nan'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "You probably will prefer using the last version, since it is compact, and provides the same functionality as the first option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered vs Unordered dictionaries (advanced)\n",
    "Dictionaries are an ***unordered*** container; though in the very recent versions of Python 3.7 above they are now ordered in the order that you add key-values. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means the above dictionary is created in a certain order (not necessarily as shown in the code!), but once you add new key-values sequentially, they will retain that order. This means if you create an empty dictionary, and add pairs ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "testing_order = {}\n",
    "testing_order['key1'] = 45\n",
    "testing_order[2] = 'Yes, keys can even be integers!'\n",
    "testing_order[3.0] = 'Or floating point objects'\n",
    "testing_order.keys()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "... that they will retain the order you added them. Because this is such a new feature, and people do not quickly upgrade their Python version, you probably should not count on it being available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to test the Python version in the code, use the ``sys.version_info`` attribute:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "if (sys.version_info.major >= 3) and (sys.version_info.minor >= 7):\n",
    "    print('I can rely on ordered dictionaries!')\n",
    "    testing_order = dict()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Use the OrderedDict class from \"import collections\".')\n",
    "    from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "    testing_order = OrderedDict()\n",
    "    \n",
    "testing_order['key1'] = 45\n",
    "testing_order[2] = 'Yes, keys can even be integers!'\n",
    "testing_order[3.0] = 'Or floating point objects'\n",
