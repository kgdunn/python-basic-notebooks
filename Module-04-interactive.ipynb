    "Think, for example, the impeller speed of a batch reactor, measured every minute, during the duration of a batch. This 1-dimensional sequence is called a vector.\n",

    "You could crudely store, as we showed above, a matrix by using a list of lists, where the main list (the outside list) contains objects which themselves are lists. This is perfectly valid in Python: remember that a list can contain objects of any type, including other lists. But while this \"list-of-lists\" approach can store your data, it would not be great for calculations.\n",

Because libraries are large collections of code and are for special purposes, they are not loaded automatically when you launch Python (or IPython, or Jupyter). You have to import a library using the `import` command. For example, to import **NumPy**, you can enter:\n",
