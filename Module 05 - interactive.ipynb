    "## Vectors, Matrices and Arrays using NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly get a few definitions out of the way, and start:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's collect some objects together, first singley (scalar), then in a list (vector), then as a 'spreadsheet' (matrix), then as an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "If our collection of (numeric) objects coincidentally is only a single number, we call that a ***scalar***.\n",
    "* ```python\n",
    "scalar_1 = 45.2```\n",
    "* ```python\n",
    "scalar_2 = 0```\n",
    "* ```python\n",
    "scalar_3 = -12```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of scalars in a single row, or column, is very much like a `list` in regular Python. This collection we then call a ***vector***.\n",
    "* ```python \n",
    "list_1 = [1, 2, 6, -2, 0]```\n",
    "* ```python \n",
    "list_2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]```\n",
    "* ```python \n",
    "list_3 = [254.2, 501, 368.4, 697, 476.5, 188.2, 525.6, 451, 514]```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We say this collection has a single dimension: a single row of numbers, or a single column of numbers. If there coincidentally is 1 number in the collection, we simply call that a scalar. But in theory we can store as many numbers as we like in our vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think, for example, the impeller speed of a batch reactor, measured every minute, during the duration of a batch. This 1-dimensional sequence is called a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take several 1-dimensional vectors, but **each one of the same length**, and put them together, side-by-side then we get a ***matrix***. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```python \n",
    "matrix_1 = [ [1, 2, 6, -2], [4, 3, 2, 1] ]   # has 2 rows and 4 columns```\n",
    "* ```python \n",
    "matrix_2 = [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] ]   # has 3 rows and 3 columns```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could crudely store, as we showed above, a matrix by using a list of lists, where the main list (the outside list) contains objects which themselves are lists. But while this \"list-of-lists\" approach can store your data, it would not be great for calculations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that a vector is simply a matrix, but where one of the dimensions is equal to 1: either 1 row, or 1 column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are widely used in engineering and data analysis. Often each row is an object, or a sample, or an observation. And each column represents some sort of value measured on that object or sample. For example:\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <th></th>\n",
    "    <th>Measurement 1</th>\n",
    "    <th>Measurement 2</th>\n",
    "    <th>Measurement 3</th>\n",
    "    <th>Measurement 4</th>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr class=\"odd\">\n",
    "    <td>Sample 1</td>\n",
    "    <td>5.5</td>\n",
    "    <td>0.55</td>\n",

    "    <td>612515.7</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "This matrix would have 3 rows and 4 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take several 2-dimensional matrices, but **each one with the same number of rows and column**, and put them together, then we get a ***3-dimensional array***. \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix was a list-of-lists. We can go up to a third dimension and make a list-of-lists-of-lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why stop there? We can go to higher and higher dimensions. We use a general names for such a collection of (numeric) objects: an ***array***. \n",
    "\n",
    "An array is an *n*-dimensional structure of numbers. You can therefore say:\n",
    "* a vector is a 1-dimenional data structure\n",
    "* a matrix is a 2-dimenional data structure\n",
    "* an array is an *n*-dimensional data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/numpy/batch-data-layers-into-page-3d-structure.png\" style=\"width: 400px; float: right\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 3-dimensional array here shows data collected in a lab: we are performing the experiment several times (``N``, the layers - each layer is a matrix actually - that lies on top of each other). \n",
    "\n",
    "In each experiment we collect a matrix of data from several sensors. There are ``K`` sensors. We set the sensors to collect data on a regular interval, once every 3 seconds, for example, so that we end up with exactly the same number of samples per sensor, ``J`` values per sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the data like this is useful, because now you could perform calculations on all experiments over all time, for all sensors in array X.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example:* you can calculate the average in the direction of arrow ``J``, to reduce the *array* to a *matrix*. That matrix would be the average value of the sensor for the experiments. That reduced matrix would have ``N`` rows and ``K`` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering applications benefit from using *vectors*, or *matrices* or *arrays*: they are sequences of data all of the _same type_. Arrays behave a lot like lists in Python, except for the constraint that all elements have the same type. \n"
