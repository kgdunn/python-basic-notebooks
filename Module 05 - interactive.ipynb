    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We say this collection has a single dimension: a single row of numbers, or a single column of numbers. If there coincidentally is 1 number in the collection, we simply call that a scalar. But in theory we can store as many numbers as we like in our vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think, for example, the impeller speed of a batch reactor, measured every minute, during the duration of a batch. This 1-dimensional sequence is called a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take several 1-dimensional vectors, but **each one of the same length**, and put them together, side-by-side then we get a ***matrix***. \n",

    "\n",
    "You could crudely store, as we showed above, a matrix by using a list of lists, where the main list (the outside list) contains objects which themselves are lists. But while this \"list-of-lists\" approach can store your data, it would not be great for calculations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that a vector is simply a matrix, but where one of the dimensions is equal to 1: either 1 row, or 1 column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are widely used in engineering and data analysis. Often each row is an object, or a sample, or an observation. And each column represents some sort of value measured on that object or sample. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "In each experiment we collect a matrix of data from several sensors. There are ``K`` sensors. We set the sensors to collect data on a regular interval, once every 3 seconds, for example, so that we end up with exactly the same number of samples per sensor, ``J`` values per sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the data like this is useful, because now you could perform calculations on all experiments over all time, for all sensors in array **X**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example:* you can calculate the average in the direction of arrow ``J``, to reduce the *array* to a *matrix*. That matrix would be the average value of the sensor for the experiments. That reduced matrix would have ``N`` rows and ``K`` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering applications benefit from using *vectors*, or *matrices* or *arrays*: they are sequences of data all of the _same type_. Arrays behave a lot like lists in Python, except for the constraint that all elements have the same type. \n"

You have to import a library using the `import` command. For example, to import **NumPy**, you can enter:\n",

    "import numpy\n",
