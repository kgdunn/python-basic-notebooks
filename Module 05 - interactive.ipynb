    "4. Trigonometric and other functions\n",

    "### 1. Addition and subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Create 2 matrices, of the same shape, and let's get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "\n",
    "print(A + B)\n",

    "The ``+`` operation on two arrays is actually just a convenience. The actual function in NumPy which is being called to do the work is the ``np.add(...)`` function. \n",

    "np.add(A, B)  # does exactly the same\n",
    "\n",

    "print(np.add(A, -B))    \n",

    "These are called ***element-by-element operations***. That means, NumPy performs the operation of addition on each corresponding element in the arrays `A` and `B` and then repeats that entry-by-entry. This is also called elementwise in NumPy's documentation.\n",

    "Just like finding the [minimum or maximum](#2.--Average-value-in-every-row/column) value in every column, you might also be interested in sorting each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to sort every column **independently** of the others. In other words every column will be sorted from low to high by the end. This is in contrast to sorting based on one column, and the other rows follow with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen the ***``axis``*** input several times now, and here we will use it again to indicate which axis we would like to sort along.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "temps = np.array([[7, 9, 12, 10], \n",
    "                  [1, 4, 5, 2], \n",
    "                  [-3, 1, -2, -3], \n",
    "                  [-2, -1, -2, -2], \n",
    "                  [-3, -1, -2, -4]])\n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible to simply sort the original array. This is called ***in-place sorting***. You will see that terminology in several places in NumPy's documentation: ***in-place***. It means that the original matrix is used, calculated on, and the result is left in the same variable as the original matrix.\n",

    "You perform an in-place sort as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's see what the implication of in-place sorting is:\n",
